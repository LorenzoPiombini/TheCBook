# Introduction

<img src="img/c_logo"/>

Welcome to a modern, approachable guide to the C programming language! Inspired by *The Rust Programming Language*, which I admire for its clarity and contemporary style, this guide aims to bring a fresh perspective to learning C.  

Over the years, I’ve collected countless books on C—each valuable in their own way. However, I believe the C community could benefit from a more accessible and engaging resource. That's why I set out to create a **free, online guide** for anyone eager to explore C, whether you're a complete beginner or looking to sharpen your skills.  

No matter your experience level, this guide is designed to make learning C both **practical and enjoyable**.  



## is it C too difficult? is C form me ?

C is for **anyone who wants to understand how computers truly work**. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, C offers a level of control and efficiency that few languages can match. Here’s who can benefit from learning C:

- **Beginners who want a strong programming foundation** – C teaches you how computers manage memory, process data, and execute instructions at a low level. Mastering C makes it easier to learn other languages like C++, Rust, or even Python.  
- **Systems programmers** – C is the backbone of operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. If you want to work with Linux, write device drivers, or build firmware, C is essential.  
- **Game developers** – Many game engines (such as Unreal Engine) and graphics libraries rely on C or C++. If you want to optimize performance, understanding C is crucial.  
- **Embedded systems and IoT engineers** – Microcontrollers, sensors, and embedded devices often run on C due to its efficiency and low overhead.  
- **Security and cybersecurity professionals** – Understanding C allows you to analyze vulnerabilities, reverse-engineer software, and write secure code.  
- **Developers who want to go beyond high-level languages** – Learning C gives you insight into memory management, pointers, and manual optimization—concepts that high-level languages abstract away.  



## Why Learn C?

Learning C provides a strong foundation in programming because:

- **Efficiency and Performance**: C is a low-level language that provides direct access to memory and system resources, making it highly efficient.
- **Portability**: C programs can be compiled on a wide range of platforms with minimal changes.
- **Foundation for Other Languages**: Many modern languages, including C++, Java, and Python, are influenced by C. Mastering C helps in understanding the inner workings of these languages.
- **Control Over System Resources**: Unlike high-level languages, C gives you fine-grained control over memory and hardware.

## is C still relevant?

Yes, C remains highly relevant in 2025.  
It continues to be foundational in various domains, including operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.   
The recent release of the C23 standard in October 2024 [ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C23_(C_standard_revision)> ] introduced several enhancements, ensuring that C evolves to meet modern programming needs.  
While newer languages have emerged, C's influence is evident in many of them, and its role in system-level programming ensures its continued importance in the software development landscape.


##                                  Some famous C software: 



## Operating Systems

- **Unix** – The original Unix operating system was developed in the 1970s using C, which significantly influenced its portability and widespread adoption.  
- **Linux Kernel** – The core of the Linux operating system, the Linux kernel, is predominantly written in C, providing a stable and efficient foundation for various Linux distributions.  

## Databases

- **MySQL** – A widely used relational database management system, MySQL's server is primarily written in C and C++, ensuring robust performance and reliability.  

## Web Servers

- **Apache HTTP Server** – One of the most popular web servers globally, Apache is written in C, offering flexibility and extensive module support.  
- **Nginx** – Known for its high performance and low resource consumption, Nginx is also developed using C.  

## Text Editors and Development Tools

- **GnuCash** – A personal and small-business financial-accounting software, GnuCash is written primarily in C and supports various platforms.  
- **Bluefish** – An advanced text editor targeted towards programmers and web developers, Bluefish is developed in C and offers a multitude of features for coding and scripting.  

## Educational Software

- **GCompris** – An educational software suite comprising numerous activities for children aged 2 to 10, GCompris was originally written in C and Python.  

These examples highlight the versatility and enduring relevance of the C programming language in developing a wide array of software applications, from operating systems and databases to development tools and educational programs.


## info about source code

This documentation is acutally generated with [mdbook][book], a command line tool to create books from Markdown.
the tool is written in Rust, some of you might think, why don't you create somenthing like that in C ??  instead of using Rust ?
well, I wrote the small webserver that is serving this page and is in C!


you can find the pages on [GitHub][link].

and please join me if you want to help building this docs.
